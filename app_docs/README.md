# Category Blocking

This sample is designed to show how to use URL Filtering in Falcon Foundry. It contains a few capabilities:

1. Python functions:

   - **urlblock**: Fetches host groups information
   - **categories**: Retrieves categories from collections
   - **create-rule**: Creates firewall management blocking rules
   - **domain-analytics**: Generates domain analytics information
   - **import-csv**: Transforms category domain CSV into collections
   - **list-categories**: Lists available categories
   - **search-categories**: Searches for specific categories
   - **manage-categories**: Creates or updates categories
   - **manage-relationship**: Creates relationships between categories, rule groups, and hosts
   - **get-relationship**: Retrieves relationship information
   - **update-rules**: Updates existing rules with new URLs

2. Collections for data storage:
   - **domain**: Stores URLs and category mappings
   - **relationship**: Stores relationship information about host groups, rule groups, and categories

3. UI Pages with React components:
   - **Category Blocking Policy**: Main interface for creating firewall rules
   - **Custom Categories**: Management of domain categories
   - **Domain Analytics**: Visualization of domain data
   - **Firewall Rules**: Management of firewall blocking rules
   - **Relationship Graph**: Visualization of relationships between categories, rule groups, and host groups
